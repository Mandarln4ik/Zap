This application will allow you to communicate at a distance using only the Internet,
no servers or redirects, using TCP/UDP p2p tunnel with encryption

> [!TIP]
> If the application could not forward ports through NAT, then try using a different type of network connection. 
> This also means that no one will be able to connect to you from the outside (for use in a local network, use the local IP of other devices).
> Even if this did not help you, you should try Port Forwarding on your router
